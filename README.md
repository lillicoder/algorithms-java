Algorithms

Inspired by working on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I'm 
revisiting my knowledge of algorithms and producing implementations of a 
select set of them.

This is for my own education and learning and I make no guarantees about the 
correctness of this work, although I hope the implementations generally are 
correct.

DO NOT USE THIS AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR HOMEWORK OR FOR DOING TECHNICAL 
INTERVIEWS IN YOUR JOB HUNT. USING THIS CODE WITHOUT THE LICENSE IN EACH FILE 
IS NOT ONLY TASTELESS, BUT WILL COME BACK TO BITE YOU WHEN YOUR 
PROFESSOR/INTERVIEWER DOES A GOOGLE SEARCH AND FINDS THIS REPOSITORY.

All work is done targeting Java 1.8.
