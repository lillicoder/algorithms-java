Algorithms

Inspired by working on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I'm revisiting my knowledge of algorithms and
producing implementations of a select set of them.

This is for my own education and learning and I make no guarantees about the quality of this work, although I hope
the implementations will be generally correct.

DO NOT USE THIS AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR HOMEWORK OR FOR DOING TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS IN YOUR JOB HUNT. USING THIS
CODE WITHOUT THE LICENSE IN EACH FILE IS NOT ONLY TASTELESS, BUT WILL COME BACK TO BITE YOU WHEN YOUR PROFESSOR/INTERVIEWER
DOES A BASIC GOOGLE SEARCH AND FINDS THIS REPOSITORY.

All work is done in Java 1.8.
